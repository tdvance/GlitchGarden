# GlitchGarden
A basic clone of the popular Plants vs. Zombies using assets from a defunct game "Glitch" that were released to the community (http://www.glitchthegame.com/).

* The object of the game is to stop animals from entering your house.

* Animals come in randomly from the right.

* Animals are limited to one of five horizontal lanes. 

* The player can place defenses in any of the lanes in the garden

* Defense placement is limited to one of nine columns, only one per square at a time.

* Defense types include projectiles, and blockers.

* When a projectile hits an animal it takes damage.

* When an animal hits a plant or blocker, it starts damaging it.

* When animals take a finite amount of damage, they disappear.

* Animals do not collide with each other.

* Projectiles do not collide with defenses or other projectiles.

* When an animal reaches a defense it stops and deals damage.

* When the defense has taken sufficient damage, it dies and disappears from the scene.

* Animals start walking again once the defense disappears.

* Defenses can be placed only when you have collected enough credits.

* You collect credits by placing a special type of collector plant which is defenseless.

* There are at least 2 types of animals (e.g. standard, jumping)

* There are at least 2 types of defenses (e.g. sun producer, cactus)
